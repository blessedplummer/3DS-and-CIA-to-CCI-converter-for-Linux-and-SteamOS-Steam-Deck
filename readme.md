Because Azahar doesn't read .3ds and .cia files and the other scripts require too much keyboard use for a steam deck with touchpads. (the steam keyboard does not jive well with the terminal)

Download this repo as a zip file, extract it, then double click "3DS Decrypt.desktop"

It should ask you where your 3ds, cia, or zip archive with those files are and then it should automatically download the files and give you a .cci file to use with Azahar with Emudeck.

You should not need to do anything else. It does everything for you. If you have backups of your 3DS games made before Azahar made the change, this will help you out.
